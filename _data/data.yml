    title: About
    summary: |
      I am a graduate student, pursuing my Masters in Cybersecurity Engineering from 
      University of Washington in Bothell. My interests lie in machine learning security with a focus on
      security in NLP models. Most of my time is spent researching attacks and defenses on NLP based 
      deep learning models. Outside of this, I like to spend my time with my husband, my dog Kiki, 
      reading books and hiking.
